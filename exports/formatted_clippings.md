"Said Krishna to Arjuna, “It is better to fail at your own dharma than to succeed at the dharma of someone else.”" (page: 26)

"that sva dharma, your own dharma, is equivalent to sva bhava, your own being." (page: 27)

"It’s important to remember that The Gift is not itself dharma. It is only, as the old saying goes, a finger pointing to the dharma." (page: 27)

"Her life, as she herself describes it in her autobiography, Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey, is one of fulfillment—an exuberant connection with the natural world, and with God." (page: 29)

"As a child, her gifts were named, celebrated, cherished, and nurtured." (page: 30)

"And only this kind of trust will allow us to learn to take risks in pursuit of The Gift—risks that will often be required in the expression of dharma." (page: 32)

"We have a responsibility to The Gift. The Gift is God in disguise." (page: 32)

"This is what a life of certitude looks like. Rather than conflict and drama, all of Goodall’s energy went into her creativity, until finally she ignited into that bonfire of contribution to the world." (page: 33)

"Jane’s experience is what we might call the Direct Path to Dharma." (page: 33)

"We can only authentically be who we are. “The attempt to live out someone else’s dharma brings extreme spiritual peril,”" (page: 34)

"When a life is founded on self-betrayal, the habit of self-betrayal proliferates until we are at peril of not remembering who we are at all." (page: 35)

"There is a slow deadening of spirit as we try to pick up the burdens of adulthood without the energy of The Gift." (page: 35)

"Our work can be motivated by obligation, by hunger for the external rewards of accomplishment, or by strongly reinforced ideas about who we should be in this lifetime. But none of these motivations has the authentic energy required for mastery of a profession." (page: 35)

"As her connection to her dharma matures, she increasingly has a sense that she is not the doer of her actions, but that God is working through her." (page: 36)

"The only question that makes sense to ask is: Is your life working for you?" (page: 38)

Thoreau’s failure in New York was a life lesson. Be who you are. Do what you love. Follow your own distant drummer. “A man’s own calling ought not to be forsaken!” (page: 42)

"We only know who we are by trying on various versions of ourselves." (page: 42)

"a dharma error most of us have made at one point or another in our lives: the attempt to be big. The attempt to be, in fact, bigger than we are. A confusion about the right size of a life of dharma." (page: 42)

"Grandiosity motivates us to try to be bigger than we could possibly be. Devaluing makes us think of ourselves as smaller than we actually are." (page: 43)

"“Be resolutely and faithfully what you are,” said Thoreau—not who you think you should be." (page: 44)

"“Think of the small as large,” wrote Lao Tzu, the author of the Tao te Ching." (page: 44)

"“See yourself as a grain of sand,” suggests Chögyam Trungpa, the Tibetan crazy-wisdom guru, “see yourself as the smallest of the small. Then you can make room for the whole world.”" (page: 44)

"“human nature in general is revealed to each person through his own nature in particular.”" (page: 45)

"One emancipated heart and intellect! It would knock the fetters from a million slaves.”" (page: 45)

"Each jewel in Indra’s net represents both itself as a particular jewel, and, at the same time, the entire web. So, any change in one gem would be reflected in the whole. Indeed, the individual gem is the whole. In the words of Indologist Sir Charles Eliot, “Every object in the world is not merely itself but involves every other object and in fact IS everything else.”" (page: 46)

"It is in this way—merely by being itself—that one jewel holds together its own particular corner of Space and Time. The action of each individual soul holds together the entire net. Small and large at the same time." (page: 47)

"Krishna teaches about dharma: “Dharma upholds both this-worldly and other-worldly affairs,”" (page: 47)

"Dharma upholds and expresses the order, harmony, and essential nature of individual beings in the world, and at the same time upholds an unseen inner world order. (It is this order and harmony that had been threatened on the field of Kurukshetra, and that could only be saved by Arjuna’s faithfully playing his small role—just as Thoreau would later play his.)" (page: 47)

"Small as they may appear, they have the power to uphold the essential inner order of the world." (page: 47)

"As it turns out, his exotic experiment took place a scant mile and a half from home." (page: 48)

"Every base is covered somehow, but only if everyone acts on their authentic calling." (page: 50)

"What is my life really about? Does my little dharma really matter? These doubts, when their tracks have been laid down early, become remarkably intractable. And they create suffering." (page: 51)

"And right in that balance, Thoreau found the correct size for his life. And his dharma exploded with energy. Right size is everything. Think of the small as large." (page: 51)

"The tortured clinging to an earlier expression of The Gift very often precedes the emergence of some new version." (page: 55)

"“Behold,” he had written earlier in Leaves of Grass (as if foreshadowing his work in the hospitals), “I do not give lectures or a little charity. When I give I give myself.”" (page: 59)

"(ambivalence, it turns out, is an unavoidable companion in the search for a new dharma):" (page: 62)

"(T. S. Eliot said it: “Old men ought to be explorers.”)" (page: 62)

"This is precisely what Krishna teaches Arjuna: You cannot hold on to your life. You don’t need to. You are immortal. “Our bodies are known to end, but the embodied self is enduring, indestructible, and immeasurable; therefore, Arjuna, fight the battle!”" (page: 62)

"The Gift is not for its own sake. It is for the common good. It is for The Times." (page: 62)

"We see here the themes that will occupy the rest of the book: Selflessness. Sacrifice. Surrender. Not just responsibility to The Gift itself, but responsibility to give it in the way that is called forth. Krishna says, “Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind.”" (page: 63)

"Dharma is born mysteriously out of the intersection between The Gift and The Times. Dharma is a response to the urgent—though often hidden—need of the moment." (page: 66)

"This little corner of the world is ours to transform. This little corner of the world is ours to save." (page: 66)

"“From around the age of six,” the artist began, “I had the habit of sketching from life.” He continues: “I became an artist, and from fifty on began producing works that won some reputation, but nothing I did before the age of seventy was worthy of attention. At seventy-three, I began to grasp the structures of birds and beasts, insects and fish, and of the way plants grow. If I go on trying, I will surely understand them still better by the time I am eighty-six, so that by ninety I will have penetrated to their essential nature. At one hundred, I may well have a positively divine understanding of them, while at one-hundred and thirty, forty, or more I will have reached the stage where every dot and every stroke I paint will be alive. May Heaven, that grants long life, give me the chance to prove that this is no lie.”" (page: 67)

"Later, at home, I Googled Hokusai. He died at eighty-nine, and sure enough, on his deathbed—still looking to penetrate deeper into his art—he had exclaimed, “If only heaven will give me just another ten years!… Just another five more years, then I could become a real painter.”" (page: 68)
